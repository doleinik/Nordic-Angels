                        Nordic Angels was created by Ash Pournouri and Andreas Grape in the year of the pandemic, in
                        August of 2020, as the need for community and collaboration became more apparent than ever. As
                        the world took a giant leap into digitalisation, there was a clear need to do the same for the
                        startup community with no competent solution in sight.The vision stems from a necessity to build
                        a stronger presence and position for capital, competence and community in local startup
                        ecosystems, rather than seeing the Nordic region being disfavoured for larger financial markets.
